# TS-Mocha-API 

TS-Mocha-API is a demonstration API and Mocha-Chai-Chakram test suite written by James Tanner in November 2024. 

## Installation

To run locally, spin up a fresh MongoDB container in a Docker volume. By default the program looks for the container at:
```bash
mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/local
```
Then run `npm install` to install the program.

## Usage

In Terminal run `npm run watch` to run the server. The API should be available at `http://localhost:3000/`.

To call the API once it's running, feel free to use the Postman collection in the base of the repo.
